Comparatively speaking to Leeloo v1, Leeloo v2.x and Leeloo-Micro v1.x have switch positions that are hot swappable.  In other words, the optional rotary encoder locations are also hot swappable.

This may be helpful in situations when wish to add rotary encoders on the go.

## Switches
Installing switches should be relatively intuitive.  Align the switch leads with the hot swap receptacles and press down evenly.  You may wish to assist the switch into its location by using a small flathead screwdriver to gingerly press the tabs in which retain the switch in position.

## Rotary Encoders
Rotary encoders are very similar to switches, except that there are 5 leads you need to align with the receptacles.  You may be required to slightly bend the legs of the rotary encoder to align with the receptacles, however, not very much.  Just enough to align the leads so when the rotary encoder is seated into position, the legs do not bend, or fold over.

When removing a rotary encoder, pull straight up.
