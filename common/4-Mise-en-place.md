# Mise en place
As a common approach to the build process, you may notice that I like to prepare all the comonents and align them in accordance to the location they will be soldered to the PCB.  This helps reduce the risk of installing a particular component backwards or even upside-down when it comes to the RGB LEDs.

Counting and aligning each component ensures you are not missing any and keeps you moving smoothly.

## Cleaning the Shields
Not likely a required step, but I like to work with clean components.  I use a lint free cloth and dampen it with a little bit of 99% IPA.  With the moist cloth, I gently wipe down the complete surface of the left and right shields.  It helps remove any manufacturing residue, fingerprints, and oils that may have been transferred from handling.
