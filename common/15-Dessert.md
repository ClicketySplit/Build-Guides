# Bottom Plate
Installation of the bottom plates include:
* Placing up to 6 bumpons on each plate.
   * Based on your preference; considering your workspace, place the bumpons to ensure the best balance and stability.
* Fastening 5 brass stand-offs with 5 torx screws—for each side.
* Attaching the bottom plate to the completed left|right case via the remaining screws—for each side.

# Keycaps
The only step left is to place your keycaps according to your keymap!

# You did it!
Well, how do you feel?  Did you enjoy building your Leeloo keyboard?

I'd love to hear all about it, and what's more?  I'd love for you to share pictures of your Leeloo!
